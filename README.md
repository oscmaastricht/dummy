### Funding for journals that use APCs?

The VSNU has collected at a national level a database with a lot of information on scholarly journals.
This includes information on whether the journal asks APC for CC-BY publishing (a majority of journals
do not), and if that APC is already prepaid: [https://openaccess.nl/](https://openaccess.nl/)
For example, we learn that no APC deal has been made for Nature (on 2020-07-14), which we learn on
[this page](https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/jbrowser/60).

## Open Source

UM has an experimental(?) GitLab instance at [https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/](https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).
It is currently not public and can be used by logging in with your UM account.
