# How to get started with using Open Science?

On the internet this famous quote is often mention about introducing yourself to someone you have not met yet: state your name, your relation with the other, and the expected outcome of your interaction:

    "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." -- Inigo Montoya

## Introducing yourself

### "My name is ..."

Your CV is nowadays more than a A4 you send as PDF. Instead, many open scientists have online profiles, sometimes as a formal CV, often as a collection of profiles on social and scholarly media. For many, this starts with a profile provide by your university.

* organize your UM profile
* get/update your ORCID
* let people know how to contact you (phone, email, twitter, mastodon, facebook, linkedin, ...)

### "You ..."

"... may be interested in my research". The main purpose of conference posters, is to interest others in your research. Traditionally, this was papers, talks, and posters, but in an open science world, all aspects of your research may interest others: data, source code, methods, visual representations, summaries, literature collections, etc, etc.

* organize your research output (e.g. make it FAIR)
* track impact (e.g. with altmetric.com or Plume)

### "Prepare to ..."

"... collaborate on open science". Because you already explained people what your connection to the other is, this last step is about giving information what you expect them to do. For example, should they cite you if they use your data? Do you welcome changes? How should they provide feedback?

Traditionally, scholarly journals organized a lot of this. But peer review can happen much earlier. This is the collaborative aspect of open science that will benefit your research.

* provide licenses to your data that explain what you expect others to do when they build on your research
* explain how you like to get cited (also think about software and data citations)

### Funding for journals that use APCs?

The VSNU has collected at a national level a database with a lot of information on scholarly journals.
This includes information on whether the journal asks APC for CC-BY publishing (a majority of journals
do not), and if that APC is already prepaid: [https://openaccess.nl/](https://openaccess.nl/)
For example, we learn that no APC deal has been made for Nature (on 2020-07-14), which we learn on
[this page](https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/jbrowser/60).

## Open Source

UM has an experimental(?) GitLab instance at [https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/](https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).
It is currently not public and can be used by logging in with your UM account.
